questions: 

1- is it ok to use helper function ? will they insert them in the database before testing ?
2- should we create a database ?






to do before submission :-

1- drop extra functions that I and mohamed created in dropAllFunctions

2 - page 3 , (v) , delete matches on stadium , couldn't delete match because it is referenced by hostrequest , so we should make that foreign key : (on delete set null)
